The white light in the middle/right is the light down the street at Innuit.  Notice the 2 poles together, one is the light that is OUT!  I hope you have this fixed by next Monday, Halloween.

Early morning and at night, it is too dangerous to walk because it is pitch dark in the parking lot and on the corner of Voltaire and West Point Loma.  There are many homeless individuals and other individuals using drugs in this area after dark and early morning. Also, I have rarely seen any police presence in this area after dark.My favorite thing about Ocean Beach is the walkability factor, but I do not feel safe walking after dark because of the lack of street lights. My little pup is suffering because I don't feel it's safe to walk on an Unlit street after dark. Surrounding streets including Abbott and Long Branch have long stretches of complete darkness as well. Please help by checking the Dog Beach parking lot and surrounding area to ensure it is properly lit.Many thanks!"

Due to differences in street elevation, without the shield, the light shines directly into my and my neighbors bedrooms and living rooms. The shield had been in place for more than two decades. The driver could not consider replacing it since he had some sort of work order.  (I could not find a number on the pole; a number on the light fixture reads 85 120,)    This issue has already been reviewed by City Engineering, who acknowledged the error on March 15, 2019.  Oddly, the original backshield/reflector was simply relocated to a nearby light pole on Brillden Court.  If a new one is not available, an expedient solution would be to simply restore the old backshiled to its previous location.  Thank You!

We live in the Pinnacle located at Front and Market Streets.  The blue lights that line Market Street for the Marina District are not working between Front and Union Streets.  Is it possible for someone to check into this for us?  The lights are so pretty when we walk our dog at night and would appreciate if we could get the section in front of our building operational.

There is a video online showing an elementary school demanding a similar 5G cell tower be taken down after several children developed a brain cancer after it was installed!!!  This is just one of many in San Diego.  There is also a giant fake tree that is a huge 5G cell tower at Winterwood Lane Park, near 7545 Winterwood Ln, San Diego, CA 92126.

There is an electrical wire in the alley behind my house that is getting lower and lower. It goes from the upper wiring down to one of the units in my complex. I contacted SDG&e a few weeks ago when it was low enough that I could almost touch it with my hand reaching up. But now it's almost at the level of my head when I'm walking to my parking space. At this rate in about a month it will probably be waist high. SDG&e said they would send someone out to take care of it but nothing has ever happened. Maybe it's not their wire? Maybe Cox?
