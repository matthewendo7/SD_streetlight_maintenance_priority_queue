When they turn off, they create a vast dark space and it is not safe while walking or jogging after dark. As the days get shorter, I fear this will create an increased hazard to anyone using the park sidewalk after dark. In addition, the lights help deter the cars that linger and underage visitors that like to smoke and drink at the park.  Thank you.

For background information, I run from the SmartCorner condominium complex (Park and Broadway) north on Park Blvd up into Balboa.  I make this run three or four times a week, and I often make the run at around 5:30 in the morning. It's a dangerous run because there is a stretch of sidewalk that is so dark I can't see anything at all.  Not the broken cement, not the trees, nothing.  Yesterday I avoided a head-on collision with what I suspect was a homeless guy.  I missed him by about two inches because I had no idea he was walking on the sidewalk, and I'm pretty sure he couldn't see me either.  To help you I've tried to take a google maps image to show the approximate locations of the lights that are out.  I've attached it to this form.  Thanks for anything you can do to keep us safe on this stretch!"

I complained to the city and found the following In the Transportation & Storm Water Department  FY2014-15 budget:  

Installation of three streetlights
Mohawk Street west of 69th Street 450', north side
Mohawk Street west of 69th Street 300', south side
Mohawk Street west of 69th Street 150', north side

I thought the department was being responsive to the potential for a negligence legal issue.  However, years later, no lights have been installed.  What is the status?  This street is in disrepair and one block from El Cajon Boulevard.  Crime and tripping hazards and school safety should dictate the immediate installation of streetlights."

Street lamp lights on Paseo Del Sur between Babcock St. and Del Sur Ridge Road previously were on but have been out for several months.  Lights on Del Sur RIdge Road near Paseo Del Sur have never been turned on even though residences have been occupied nearly two years.  Street lights on Coyote Bush have also not been turned on since residences were built.  People often walk on dark sidewalks and park on darkened streets (with coyotes regularly seen in the area).  It's a safety issue and the street lights around residences should be on.  

Also, the traffic light at the corner of Camino Del Sur and Coyote Bush Dr. doesn't change properly.  If heading north on Coyote Bush to turn eastbound on Camino Del Sur and the light is red, the light to eastbound traffic on Camino Del Sur will turn yellow and traffic will slow to stop, but the sensor doesn't pick up that a car is still waiting to turn eastbound (right) and will cycle back to green for the eastbound traffic on Camino Del Sur without giving a green light to the car on Coyote Bush.  This happens often when stopped at the corner...you'll see the approaching cars on Camino Del Sur slowing to stop and then they start up again as their light goes back to green and no green light is given to the car waiting to turn right from Coyote Bush onto Camino Del Sur.  It's not a problem if turning westbound (left) onto Camino Del Sur from Coyote Bush (i.e., a green turn light will be given).

Two street light posts are missing.  One was hit by a truck two months ago and another one a few months before that.  Sometime last year these street lamps had the original lights fixture upgraded to LED lamps.  The original spacing between the posts were designed for a higher lumens output lamp.  Since the LED's were installed there are dark gaps now between the lamp post.  Now with two post missing it is even worst.  Also when the new LED fixtures were installed, they used the wrong bolts to secure the fixture to the post.  These bolts are about 3 inches long and a 3/4 inch bolt would have been long enough.
Please replace the two missing lamp post and consider a higher out put LED fixture on each one."

I am sure others have written also but the street light across from my house at 5158 Marlborough Drive has been out for over two weeks as has the one at the corner of my block in front of 5188 Marlborough Drive and the one across the street on the corner near 5201 Marlborough.  Likewise the lights on the 4100 block of Middlesex around the corner from us are out as are the lights on the other portion of the 5100 block of Marlborough Drive south of us. Driving in my neighborhood shows that the outage is not limited to the blocks i mentioned.   It appears not to be a bulb issue as all of the lights in the locations I identified just stopped coming on one day a few weeks ago.  It is extremely dark in the evenings especially for those of us who need to take dogs out.  I would appreciate any efforts that could be made to look into this and correct it if possible.  Thank you.

To this day there has been no action taken it is covered up partially with a cone,  with small re-bars sticking out of it which is a hazard as children play in our common property  and heavy pedestrian traffic along sidewalk.  This needs to be corrected ASAP ,..  we have also numerous situations , even one emergency vehicle came with no street sign showing Calle Mariselda. Also, the light is highly needed as it was positioned to lighten up a bend on a rather fast slight downhill , let alone for security as well.  Our cross street is Antigua Boulevard if you look it up there was several people probably called in the issue..  I looked it up on your map and it shows not anything on our corner needs attention from reports ,something is going on with not following up. Please look into this matter as soon as practical.

 Darn it, I'm sorry to say that this evening when it was dark the lights are still not working :o(.
I thought if you knew that they were not work that it might be helpful for you to trouble shoot?  because I'm sure that they operate on a photo cell, either the circuit is not energized or maybe a problem with the photocell? Looking forward to them working again.

Our home is located at 3009 Goldsmith Street 92106, on the corner of Rosecrans St...Our driveway is on the Rosecrans Street side... next to the house at 2710 Rosecrans St.  
The street light at the foot of our driveway has been out off and on for years!  For the last 4 years it has been off more than on...I have reported this several times to no avail...Recently 9/23/16 Report #00107686...11/2/2016 Report #00115804...1/9/2017 Report #00131331...NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE, AND I HAVE HEARD NOTHING REGARDING THE REPAIR!  
Also, the light directly across the street at 2735 Rosecrans in front of Quarters C (Liberty Station) is out,  and has been for over a year...It is pitch black!... 
Without street lights it is creating a safety issue with the homeless in our driveway next to our motorhome.  This also promotes criminal activity in the neighborhoods in Loma Portal as the lights  are out in many areas. 
 It is very dark in our block on Rosecrans (2710)..We host international students (4) at a time, and they are questioning their safety coming home at night with it being so dark by the driveway, and across the street...
We pay for our lighting in our property taxes!  I feel our street lights should be working at all times, and if not, repaired in a timely manner...

Can you be kind enough to let me know when I can expect our lights to be fixed permanently, or who I should contact to expedite this matter.

Thank you,

It's been on & off since last October. And as far as I can see, the street light just down the street and the one on the corner of Hart Drive / Argos Drive are also out.

I've also noticed that the street lights down the street (on Hart Drive, closer to Alder Drive and on Alder Drive) have been ""on"" 24/7 lately.

I have small children and we also have a lot of coyotes living in the canyon just below our house. For safety reasons, I would greatly appreciate if this matter be taken care of right away.

Attached is a picture of a street light post in Mission Hills that is located right in the middle of an intersection near presidio park.

Notice that the bottom is damaged from being hit.

Also notice that the light poll is painted deep blue to make it almost impossible to see.

Either the light post should be removed from the middle of the intersection, or it  should be painted completely white and covered with reflective material so that cars, when approaching at night, can see the durn thing.

In the meantime, it has been damaged THIS TIME and left unrepaired for nearly six months making it not only serious hazard but an embarrassment to the city administration in District 3.

We just moved into a new house at 12745 Via Esperia in Del Mar.  There is a street light in front of the house that shines directly into the master bedroom which has a solid wall of windows facing the light.  Is there any way to shield the light a little so that it does not shine towards the house? Even with blinds we cannot block the light.   We noticed that one of the lights up the block seems to have some type of shield on it (see attached photos) and we wondered if that might help in our situation.

Street lamp outages
This is my second request.
I live near the pier on niagara and the tall street lamp - the last one on the left before you enter the pier- the light is out and its very dark. I am 74 and fell tonite.
The other thing is that there is a lot of questionable activity at tge pier in the dark.
Thanks very much

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Lights on 54th and Montezuma

Hello Claudia, 

I am Roberto Torres, with Councilmember G�mez?s office. We met earlier in the year regarding Kensington street light outages. 

I have gotten several reports that numerous street lights on the 54th and Montezuma block have been out for a few weeks. Would you happen to know what?s causing the outage? What can we do to resolve this issue?

Thank you very much for your attention to this matter. 

I look forward to your reply."

Directors,
Below is the contact number for Public Works and email for future reference. I have also placed a work order with the supervisor to try an expedite the repairs/replacement for safety, notice the time frame has changed. I spoke to Michael Grey the supervisor for the street service and he should be contacting me back with an estimated time frame for the repairs. 
If you would like to call and request to speak to a supervisor to state the lights being out are a safety issue, it may speed up the progress, for repairs. Please use the word safety several times.
Respectfully,

I just got off the phone with Michael Grey from TSW street service.  An electrician has been issued the work order and the lights should be replaced today or tomorrow at the latest.  If no repairs/replacements are completed by the 17th please contact Mr. Grey (Supervisor)  directly at 619-527-8056 and reference #15-757-822 700 Hornblend St.

The boardwalk lights on or near 4461 Ocean Blvd, San Diego CA 92109 have been out for over a week.  The Association has contacted a list of people to have the lights turned on for safety reasons. Just last week a raid was completed near this area. The lights are a major safety issue and have not been repaired/replaced.  Please address this issue and advise.

I do not know what the problem is but suspect a bad bulb. It has been this way verging on two years now. I've submitted a report for this last year (2015) as well. The entire street is extremely dark at night and there is no another streetlight for quite a ways. This presents a safety concern for residents and especially children when they are walking in the evening or at night. On the nights when there is no moonlight the entire street could be pitch black up to the next street light that is working. Please fix this light. My vehicle was broken into this past Saturday night and personal belongings were taken and medication.

Hello Andy,
Thank you for your concern, I have a ticket in with The City of San Diego street department to do just this. They are short staffed and have not been able to make it out to re-bulb the park. They are aware of the issue and will be out here I just do not know when. You could contact them from their website or call the department and see if you can get answers from them. That is where the ball is right now, Streets Division.
Thanks again,
Eric

Subject: RB Community Park- F8 Lights
 
Hi Eric,
 
I'm a coach and RB Little league board member, and we have noticed that several of the light bulbs at RB Community Park Field F8 appear to be burned out.  We played a little league baseball game on F8 a week ago and noticed that the light levels seemed dim due to burned out lights, and it was hard to see the ball.
 
We would greatly appreciate it if you can have some one replace the burned out light bulbs at F8.  Please let me know if there is anything you need from me to get this process going asap.
Thanks,
Andy Kutzner"

We seem to have had an increase in car vandalism and having the street light on is a deterrent to crime also the street is very dark and between all the sidewalk and street cracks and holes and the street work being done on the curbs (handicap accessible???)  this is a potential accident waiting to happen that could result in  yet again an injury that results in another costly lawsuit for the city.

There is a street light that has been out for two years. I live directly across the driveway off Mount Aguilar Street next to the STRATTON APARTMENT SIGN. The street light pole is directly across the street when you go into the driveway to go into the shopping center off Mount Alifan on the backside of Vons.

I was told only that light, but I suggest you check all lights on that strip before the traffic light down the street.  Very much appreciated.

To Whom It may Concern:

Our home is located at 3009 Goldsmith Street 92106, on the corner of Rosecrans St...Our driveway is on the Rosecrans Street side... next to the house at 2710 Rosecrans St.  
The street light at the foot of our driveway has been out off and on for years!  For the last 4 years it has been off more than on...I have reported this several times to no avail...Recently 9/23/16 Report #00107686...11/2/2016 Report #00115804...1/9/2017 Report #00131331...NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE, AND I HAVE HEARD NOTHING REGARDING THE REPAIR!  
Also, the light directly across the street at 2735 Rosecrans in front of Quarters C (Liberty Station) is out,  and has been for over a year...It is pitch black!... 
Without street lights it is creating a safety issue with the homeless in our driveway next to our motorhome.  This also promotes criminal activity in the neighborhoods in Loma Portal as the lights are out in many areas. 
 It is very dark on our block on Rosecrans (2710)..We host international students (4) at a time, and they are questioning their safety coming home at night with it being so dark by the driveway, and across the street...
We pay for our lighting in our property taxes, and  I feel our street lights should be working at all times, and if not, repaired in a timely manner..Being in the dark of over a year is not acceptable, and if it were in the area of your home I think you would feel the same.  This is definitely a safety issue.
Can you be kind enough to let me know when I can expect our lights to be fixed permanently, or who  I should contact to expedite this matter.

Thank you,

Judy Graves

Report Category: Street Light

Address: 8135 El Paseo Grande, La Jolla, CA, United States
Description: There is a street light out next to my home at/or right next to 8135 El Paseo Grande on the East Side of the Street. The light is a Low Pressure Sodium (LPS), that emits the yellow light. It is well needed on this street as no-one can see at night getting to their cars from local restaurants and for the elder to be able to walk their dogs safely.

It looks like a street light and it has 2 lights on 1 pole and it's right in the center of the parking lot if you look at it on google maps.  Those lights are not Taco Bell's and Starbucks doesn't know if it's theirs. Anyway the problem is that those lights have never been on for years and it's a little dark in the parking lot and it would be nice to know who is in charge of those lights so they can be fixed.

We pay a special assessment with our property taxes for street lights maintenance and for that we get very poor service.  It is also a dangerous situation because the light at 1460 Wilbur is at the intersection of 2 dark sidewalks with tall bushes nearby that are 6+ feet high, making the sidewalks even darker.  On July 4, someone was lighting fireworks on the grass where the street light should illuminate, thereby adding to the risk of starting a dangerous fire.  When the lights are not functioning, people sit in the darkness regularly, while they smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol.  Then they throw the cigarette butts, empty beer cans and bottles in our yards.   Please do your job and fix the lights!!!!!"

When I say broke I mean the light bulb is not the problem and that is why there is a piece of tape hanging from the light fixture.  The man that fixes the lights puts the tap hanging from the light when a new bulb doesn't fix the problem.  that tape has been hanging on this light for years.

We're wondering if the city has a street light shield or shade that can be installed on a street light that is directing light into our bedroom window. The light is in front of 560 Arenas Street, La Jolla 92037.

Photos attached are 1) of the street light to help identify the model/type, 2) the light coming in past our tree into our bedroom, and 3) an option we've seen installed before. 

There was no option for this request; so my apologies for choosing ""Light On During Day""... I didn't know which to select. 

Thank you in advance for your assistance. 

All best,

These lights still haven't been fixed.  There are 4 lights total out in a row (2 posts with 2 lamps each).  Cant believe the city is contributing to this neighborhoods blight by giving those that drive through here the impressions that the area must have been shut down or something.  Ive followed up and asked to be called by a supervisor but never received a call.  Please fix these lights or be responsive to my request for more information on why these lights right by my house and the joint use park are still out."

Basically, it appears that there is NO routing maintenance taking place. These inoperative lights make the roads very dark at night thus creating a driving hazard. I recommend you send someone out at night to see for yourself and identify the vast number of lights that are not working so you can repair this situation. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

I know the electricians are all busy but is there any ways to get some of these lights fixed as soon as possible.  Please and Thank you.

Request some type of action reply.  This problem was reported on December 3, 2018, and CLOSED on December 14,2018, and as of Saturday, June 15th during our patrol it was still INOP.

This is a dark mid-block area in the 600 block of University Ave, with high pedestrian traffic at night, and is attracting homeless to camp out due to low lighting.

Since the original report, the following has been posted in crime mapping in the 600 block of University Ave:

1.1.19, Disorderly Conduct; Alcohol
1.26.19, Petty Theft/Theft of Personal Property/Shoplift
3.4.19, Disorderly Conduct: Drugs or Drugs with Alcohol
3.23.19, Petty Theft
3.28.19, Assault with Deadly Weapon other than Firearm or GBI Force.

Please advise the course of action to get this resolved.

Respectfully,

Sean R. Redmond

These (4) street lights [not traffic lights] are still out.   I was at the intersection at 9:00PM this evening [08-22-20], and none of these lights were lit, making the intersection corner very dark at night.  There are 4 crosswalks making this intersection dangerous for drivers to see pedestrians at night.  

I would be happy to meet someone from the City if need be in order to remedy this important issue.  Again, this issue was originally reported in March of 2019.
