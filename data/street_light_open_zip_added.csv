The streetlights that are out or not functioning are as follows: 1131 Wall Street, 1044 Wall Street, 7948 Herschel, 800 Silverado St., 909 Prospect, Corner of Bishops Lane and Prospect, 811 Prospect, 7876 Herschel Ave, 7838 Herschel Ave, 7817 Herschel and 935 Propesct.

A total of seven(7) lamp posts are out spanning the 1300, 1400 and 1500 blocks of 28th Street. Fixing these lamp posts shouldn't be rocket science. Either the bulb is bad or the wiring is faulty. Would greatly appreciate these lamp posts being made operable for all who enjoy walking and the park. Thank you!",

She is concerned about drivers hitting a pedestrian or safety concerns with the canyon as there was a canyon fire a year or so ago. She believes the lights being out could cause the homeless to congregate in the area and potentially cause another fire. She said she had a business card with my desk phone number as ""traffic control"" from 20+ years ago. I work downtown in water and wastewater design and suggested she use the ""Get It Done"" app but she doesn't have a cell phone or computer so I am putting this report in for her.

This location is 3 blocks East of PetCo Park and directly across from 12 & Imperial transfer station.  I visited this site due to a safety concern addressed by a Greyhound driver regarding the lighting on this block.  After investigating I find the concerns accurate.  Just about every streetlight on this block is not working.  Starts at the corner of 14th and Imperial turning onto National Ave, and on that entire block.  The area has an extreme high occupancy of homeless which the lack of lighting may contribute to this.  It not safe for all pedestrians walking in the area in the dark and as you may know this is a very heavy foot traffic area.  I found the only thing illuminating the area are lights from MTS, Greyhound Station, and vehicles that drive by.  I hope you find this information critical and prompt it to the top of the must fix immediately list. It is a dangerous area for pedestrians and not to mention the Padre season is about to start.  Please let me know your findings and concerns.Thank you, Tiffany MorenoGreyhound Safety Manager 619.576.2003 mobile",

Be cautious about clicking on any links in this email or opening attachments.** ________________________________There are about 12 light poles on the MLK walkway between Front and Union between the New Children?s Museum?s play area and the trolley tracks. Each light fixture holds four lights but only one on each pole is on at night, unlike the MLK in front of CityFront Terrace where all four of the lights are turned on.Many baseball fans, symphony goers, conventioneers, as well as CityFront Terrace residents use this stretch of the MLK. It?s very dark at night and certainly creates a safety issue. The last time I walked this part of the MLK, men were hiding in the shadows.Please turn these lights back on before someone gets assaulted along this stretch.  The safety of pedestrians certainly outweighs the savings from not operating all the lights.John KuenekeCityFront Terrace residentjohnkueneke@gmail.com314-504-5072Sent from my iPad",

It is far far brighter than any other streetlight, and is also on constantly, 24 hrs/day.   The light is just outside my bedroom window and is so bright I have trouble sleeping even with heavy curtains. It completely floods my yard with intense light continuously, which is not good for plants or wildlife either.  It seems completely unnecessary as there is a normal streetlight nearby.   The light pollution it causes is not healthy.  I have lived in this house for just a year - and I expect that it was of less concern previously as the earlier occupants of this house used this room as an office - but there are only two bedrooms, so I do not have that option.  Could the light be removed, or at least replaced with a regular bulb? Why is it on all day? Such a waste of energy too. Thank you for checking this outSleepless in San Diego",

I live next to this park and in about 2005 we raised $8000 to have the City install up-lights, here, due to how dark it was at night at the adjacent bus stop, with the agreement by the City that it would maintain these lights. At that time, the City required us to provide money for very expensive, in-ground Hydrel lights. But, when I notified the City in 2019 about a couple of lights being burned out, the City took out these very expensive lights and replaced them with cheap, above-ground lights that transients keep kicking over.

It has been ignored for three years despite being a hazard and a danger issue for our community. Multiple times the city has been alerted to this hazard.

Drivers in the dark do not see the curve and have driven onto the sidewalk and crashed into cars parked in single family home driveways.

People run the stop sign (with a crosswalk) constantly.  It is just a matter of time until someone is killed or seriously injured.  I do not know how far along Riviera the lights are out, but it is a PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARD!! And it should be relatively easy to remedy.  Is there any way to get a flashing signal at that intersection? My husband and I walk our dogs every evening, and we have had many close calls with people blasting through the stop sign.  Part of it is that the street is so dark.  Plus, the crime has increased because there are no lights!  I am imploring you to do something about this!  If someone is hurt because of this issue it is on the city!

What we have surmised so far is, maintaining the old lamps is tedious and time-consuming. The cost of rewiring the current system is prohibitive. Installing new lights would eliminate the charm of the community.Yet, public safety is the main reason for streetlights. Not charm. If the old ones are failing, what is the plan to keep residents safe? Loma Portal is a short walk for unsavory characters who might use the cover of darkness to their advantage. Could the City face legal liability for nefarious actions in unlit public areas?",

There is a 5-bulb street light with branded lamp post banners directly in front of the venue. We are hoping to understand the possibility of working with the City of San Diego and a Licensed electrician to change the bulbs to blue (we would supply approved colored bulbs), and temporarily change the lamp post banners between 7:30 PM - 11:30 PM on Sunday, August 14th. The purpose is to extend our company's brand color (blue) onto the patio slightly into the public outdoor area right outside of the venue. All lights and lamp post banners would be replaced back to their original form by the end of the evening.",

It is at the corner of a busy intersection of 2852 Poinsettia Drive, 92106 and it gets really dark here at night with lots of cars passing at high speeds often times running the stop sign due to inadequate lighting. This isn't to mention the sketchy individuals that take advantage of this, and have stolen packages from our neighbors as a result of this.

I'm just hoping we don't have to go another winter of no lighting there.  It gets dark by 5pm and families are still out and using that crosswalk during the busy evening commute. It's a cobra type light mounted directly to a telephone pole.  I thought that meant SDGE owns it and it might get done sooner.  I did report it directly to SDGE last December.  Is it possible this slipped through the cracks?  Is there any way to find out when this might get repaired by the city or SDGE?
